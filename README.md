# Machine Learning and Music: Predicting Genre
This is the repo for the 2016 jtTalks "Machine Learning and Music" session.

The student-facing content is all contained in the index.ipynb notebook, which calls out to setup.py for some convenience functions. A few data files are hosted in the repo, but the majority of the training and testing set (1000 snippets of 30 second audio, a total of 1.2 GB) sits on Dropbox, with a helper function that downloads them as needed.
